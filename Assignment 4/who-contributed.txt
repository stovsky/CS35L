To do this, I simply used the command below so I could find when this string first came to be:
$ git log -S "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."

This command outputted
commit c12b432741eed9a422fbf99fa27af6e7a941d88b refs/tags/2012e
Author: Arthur David Olson <ado@elsie>

    Eggert changes
    
    SCCS-file: northamerica
    SCCS-SID: 7.20

I noticed that Arthur David Olson authored this change on December 21, 1995.
From here, I wanted to see what actually happened in the commit, so I did:
$ git show c12b432741eed9a422fbf99fa27af6e7a941d88b

In this output, I found these lines:
+# From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
+# Indiana generally observes either EST all year, or CST/CDT,
+# but areas near Cincinnati and Louisville use those cities' timekeeping
+# and in 1969 and 1970 the whole state observed daylight time;
+# and there are other exceptions as noted below.
+# Shanks partitions Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
+# and writes ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''
+# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.

From this output, it is clear that this sentence was added into the northamerica file by Paul Eggert on December 19, 1995.
