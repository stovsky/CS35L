Differences between Git's cloned repository and ~eggert/src/github/git.

In ~eggert/src/github/git, I typed $ git branch and got this output:
  maint
* master
  next
  seen
  todo

I did the same in the cloned repository and found:
* master

As you can see, ~eggert contains extra branches such as maint, next, seen, and todo, along with the master branch contained in both.  This is because Eggert has checked out branches that I have not checked out yet in the freshly cloned repository.
