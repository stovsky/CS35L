I used the command
$ git log --grep="segfaulted"
From here I found the log:

    Merge branch 'dd/diff-files-unmerged-fix' into maint
    
    "git diff --relative" segfaulted and/or produced incorrect result
    when there are unmerged paths.
    
    * dd/diff-files-unmerged-fix:
      diff-lib: ignore paths that are outside $cwd if --relative asked

From here I checked the parent commit 8174627b3d to see what was actually merged.  I checked the other parent and scrolled through both the logs, but this seemed like the only relevant commit.
$ git log 8174627b3d
I found this:
commit 8174627b3d32dc80cb477b3fa46971955f26c6b2

    diff-lib: ignore paths that are outside $cwd if --relative asked
    
    For diff family commands, we can tell them to exclude changes outside
    of some directories if --relative is requested.
    
    In diff_unmerge(), NULL will be returned if the requested path is
    outside of the interesting directories, thus we'll run into NULL
    pointer dereference in run_diff_files when trying to dereference
    its return value.
    
    Checking for return value of diff_unmerge before dereferencing
    is not sufficient, though. Since, diff engine will try to work on such
    pathspec later.
    
    Let's not run diff on those unintesting entries, instead.
    As a side effect, by skipping like that, we can save some CPU cycles.

From here, I see that the change was authored by Đoàn Trần Công Danh.  I wanted to go a little deeper, and noticed the mention of a file diff-lib.  I tried $ git blame diff-lib but nothing came up, so I simply did $ ls and found that the file is diff-lib.c.  So, I typed
$ git blame diff-lib.c | grep "Đoàn Trần Công Danh"
And found these lines:
8174627b3d3 diff-lib.c (Đoàn Trần Công Danh     2021-08-22 15:49:08 +0700 120) 		if (revs->diffopt.prefix &&
8174627b3d3 diff-lib.c (Đoàn Trần Công Danh     2021-08-22 15:49:08 +0700 121) 		    strncmp(ce->name, revs->diffopt.prefix, revs->diffopt.prefix_length))
8174627b3d3 diff-lib.c (Đoàn Trần Công Danh     2021-08-22 15:49:08 +0700 122) 			continue;
8174627b3d3 diff-lib.c (Đoàn Trần Công Danh     2021-08-22 15:49:08 +0700 123) 

This seems to be the code that fixed the issue.
